# React + Vite

React Hooks help us to apply realtime changes in UI in shorter and fasterr way.
It decreases complexity of classical javascript.

React Hooks are special functions that allow you to use React features inside functional components.
Before Hooks, features like state and lifecycle methods were only available in class components.
Hooks make React code simpler, cleaner, and easier to reuse.

⭐ Why Hooks?

No need to write class components
Cleaner and shorter code
Reusable logic using custom hooks
Easy to manage state and side effects


✅ Summary

React Hooks make functional components powerful by adding:
State
Side effects
Global values
Performance optimizations
Reusable logic
They help keep your React code simple, clean, and easy to maintain.

🔥 Commonly Used Hooks :

useState lets your component store and update data.

useEffect lets you run side effects like:
API calls, fetching data, updating the page title, timers

useRef is used to:
access DOM elements, store values that don’t cause re-renders

useContext helps you use global values without passing props manually at every level.

useMemo helps improve performance by memoizing expensive calculations.

useCallback memoizes functions so they are not recreated every time the component re-renders

useReducer is used for complex state management (similar to Redux).

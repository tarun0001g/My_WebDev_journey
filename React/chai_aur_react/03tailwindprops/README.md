# React + Vite

Props in react

props makes components reusable.
we can call multiple time those components.

it says, we don't need to separate all js,html,css codes of any card, and call those all files when needed
instead of that, react says ,put your card in single component and call that component when needed

~props is an object
~Props are used to pass data from one component to another in React.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✔ Props = Data that a parent sends to a child component.

Just like how a function receives parameters,
a React component receives props.

after receiving props it, returns that component with changed properties
if some props(properties) are missing then, it will render default values


🔑 Key Points
Props are inputs for components
Props come from parent → to child
Props are read-only (cannot be changed)
Props help make components reusable
Props can be strings, numbers, arrays, objects, functions, JSX

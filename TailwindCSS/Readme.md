# Tailwind CSS Learning & Project Showcase 🚀

This repository documents my **Tailwind CSS learning journey** and hands-on practice. It includes:

* A **responsive PW Skills–inspired landing page** built using Tailwind CSS
* A **practice file** where I experimented with most Tailwind utilities, concepts, and responsive properties

I followed a structured tutorial and then implemented everything practically to strengthen my understanding.

I learned Tailwind CSS from the following YouTube tutorial:

This tutorial helped me understand:

* Utility-first CSS approach
* Responsive design using breakpoints
* Flexbox & Grid with Tailwind
* Spacing, typography, colors, borders, shadows
* Hover, focus, and dark mode utilities
